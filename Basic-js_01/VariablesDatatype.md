VARIABLE

//The meaning of keyword const is once declared it cannot be changed
// try to change the value of accountId
const accountId=12345
 <!--you can use const keyword when you want to define a variable in a such a way that it shouldnt be changed throughout the codebase  -->

// nowadays we dont use var but two ways to change variables let and var.
let accountusname="ramya"
var accountpass="Ra@97"
<!-- we dont use var anymore due to the issue of blocka and dunctional scope -->

accountCity="Mumbai"
<!-- Javascript is such a safe language that we dont to declare a keyword at times and if we just use a varibale it itself declares its type based on the value/string assigned to the variable -->

// two ways to print on terminal 
console.log(accountId)
console.table([accountId,accountusname,accountpass])
<!-- when a variable is not defined its value is printed as undefined on the console -->

DATATYPE

"use strict;" //use new code as new js version

alert(3+3) //this is for browser not for node.js

<!-- the main thing in coding is readability -->
console.log("rae"); console.log("hi")
//this isnt the right way to write

<!-- this is the right way -->
console.log("rae")
 console.log("hi")
